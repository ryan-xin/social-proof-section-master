# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section

![Design preview for the Social proof section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome 

I started to solve real-world HTML, CSS and JavaScript challenges on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) to improve my front-end skills by building real projects.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

Here is my [solutions](https://social-proof-section-master-teal.vercel.app/). Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

## What I learned

- Use flex to vertical and horizontal align child element: set parent 'display: flex; height: 100%; align-item: center; justify-content: center'. Set child element a width.
- Flex items gap: set parent 'gap: ??px'.
- Flex items width: set child 'flex-basis: 100%'.
- For other screen sizes, change parent 'flex-direction: column'.
- Use 'position: absolute' to break the relation to flex parent. And use 'position: static' to reestablish the relation.
